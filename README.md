# Jurassic Friends
Welcome to the repository for Jurassic friends.
Jurassic friends is a simple game which uses MediaPipe hand detection to see what hand pose you are showing the camera.

The way MediaPipe is used in this game is by a few links in the HTML. basically all you need to run the game is already there so you won't need to do any installs!

keep in mind! due to a bug I haven't managed to fix will the first pose you do always be wrong. just press okay on the alert and after that it will work the way it should.
